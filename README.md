### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a BSc Data Science undergraduate student at the London School of Economics. Currently, I'm learning Go and building a full-stack eCommerce website using Go and TypeScript. On the side, I'm also learning machine learning using Python.

Feel free to reach out to me to collaborate or just to chat :)
