### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a BSc Data Science undergraduate student at the London School of Economics. Currently, I'm working on learning and implementing machine learning in the financial fields. On the side, I also love web development. I'm looking to collaborate on anything in those two fields. 

Feel free to reach out to me to collaborate or just to chat :)
